Builds beyond the point of rupture. Designs, rigs, and runs systems where AI and human craft co-produce new forms. Turns conceptual blueprints into working worlds.

**Core Assets**

* Lab specifications
* Rig schematics
* Runbooks for repeatable deployment
* Pilots proving new workflows
* Training modules for prompt-native authors

**Engagement**
Join a pilot, adapt a runbook, move a rig into production. Supply results, metrics, refinements.

**Trajectory**
Establishes the pipelines others will depend on or compete against.
